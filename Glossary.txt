## Glossary

**Algorithms**

 An algorithm is a set of mathematical rules and instructions given to a computer that will help answer a particular problem. On example of an algorithm is the web player Spotify to calculate if you would be interested in similar bands to the ones you are already listening to. ***(Cambridge, 2018)***
 
 **Building an application**

 * Determine the requirements, usually given in a specification or proposal 
* Select a software life cycle to use e.g. Agile, Spiral, Waterfall etc.
* Make a plan keeping in mind time frames.
* Design. 
* Prototyping and debugging.
* Implementation. 
* Maintenance. 

 ## Paradigms  

 **Procedural Oriented Paradigms**

An application built using procedural oriented paradigm uses functions and algorithms to perform each task in a step by step procedure. ***(Chakrabarty, 2013)***

**Characteristics of Procedural Oriented Paradigms.**

*  The main interest is on the process of designing the code and not on data.
* Problems are divided into functions.
* Each function shares common data.
* Functions transfer data to other functions.
* Top down approach to programming.
***(Chakrabarty, 2013)***

**Object Oriented Paradigms**

This paradigm is based on objects and not on the process, its main advantages are its re-usability and modularity. It uses classes to group functions together thus helping to design complex programs such as video games. (Tutorials Point, 2014)  

**Characteristics of Object Oriented Paradigms.**

* Focuses on data and not the process.

**Event-Driven Paradigms** 

An event-driven paradigm reacts to user events or other inputs, examples include mouse inputs such as X and Y position which is detected by an event listener this then triggers a function.  (TechnologyUK, 2018)
